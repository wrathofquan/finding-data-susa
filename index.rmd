## Structure and availability of data



| Unit of Analysis                                                                       	| Geography                                                                          	| Time-Period                                                             	| Frequency                                                                                              	|
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	|-------------------------------------------------------------------------	|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	|
| Aggregated or Microdata?  (counties/nations/households vs. individuals) 	| Is there a geographic  component to your topic?  (U.S., Sub-Saharan Africa, India) 	| Do you want a data for a  specific time period?  (1980-2000, 1930-1960) 	| How often do you want measures  for your variables?  (every year, every ten years, monthly, quarterly) 	|


## Providers

| Researchers                                                    	| Government Agencies                                                                                                                                                                       	| NGO/IGOs                                                                                                                                     	| Research Organizations                                                                                                   	|
|----------------------------------------------------------------	|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	|
| Are there people you know who are doing this kind of research? 	| Think about government agencies - is the request for some official statistics or data that they'd be likely to collect and publish? (Department of Energy, CDC, Census Bureau) 	| Are there councils or interest organizations devoted to the topic that might collect data independently? (World Bank, OECD) 	| Would any specific research organizations be interested in the topic? (Pew, Roper, Gallup, ACLU ) 	|

## Mind the 80/20 Rule

> It is often said that 80% of data analysis is spent on the process of cleaning and preparing the data. 


-Dasu and Johnson


## Tidy Data

> “Happy families are all alike; every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.” 

– Leo Tolstoy


> “Tidy datasets are all alike, but every messy dataset is messy in its own way.” 

– Hadley Wickham


##Tidy Data = Happy Data

Tidy Data has the following attributes:

Each variable forms a column and contains values

Each observation forms a row
